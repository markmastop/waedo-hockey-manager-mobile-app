Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// At line 1089, add missing closing bracket for makePlayerToPositionSubstitution function
  };

// At line 1091, add missing closing bracket for swapPlayerPositions function
  };

// At line 1093, add missing closing bracket for MatchScreen component
}
```

The main issues were:

1. Missing closing bracket for the `makePlayerToPositionSubstitution` function
2. Missing closing bracket for the `swapPlayerPositions` function 
3. Missing closing bracket for the entire `MatchScreen` component

The code should now be properly closed with all required brackets in place. The structure is now complete and should compile correctly.
